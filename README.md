# Hindi Language Benchmarking Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains the first comprehensive Hindi language benchmarking dataset designed to evaluate the intelligence of language models (LLMs) in Hindi. The dataset includes 1000 questions across various topics and difficulty levels, providing a robust tool for assessing the capabilities of LLMs in understanding and processing the Hindi language.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is meticulously curated to encompass a wide range of question types and topics, ensuring a thorough evaluation of different linguistic and cognitive skills. The questions are categorized into the following topics:

1. **Logical and Common Sense Reasoning**
2. **Difficult Word Problems**
3. **Mathematical Problems**
4. **Emotional Dilemmas**
5. **Analogies**
6. **Grammar and Syntax**
7. **Pattern Recognition**
8. **Reading Comprehension**

Each question is designed to challenge the LLMs across various aspects of language understanding, reasoning, and problem-solving, ranging from easy to complex levels.

## Sample Questions

To give you an idea of what the dataset looks like, here are a few sample questions:

1. **Logical Reasoning**
   - Question: "नीचे दिए गए विकल्पों में से किस संख्या श्रृंखला को पूरा करेगा? 2, 6, 12, 20, ___"
   - Answer: "30"

2. **Reading Comprehension**
